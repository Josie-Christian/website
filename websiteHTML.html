<h3>About Me:</h3>
<body>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Josie! I'm a developer and a writer! </p>
<p>

  I am deeply passionate about the interpersonal connections that we make through our lives.
  Across my career, I have worked in a wide variety of industries focusing on the human elements
  of our society. I have experience as a Disability Support Professional, I've managed programs for nonprofits,
  and I've run outreach and data entry for the Goodwill Corporation. Across these fields, I've used technology
  and communication skills to create a meaningful impact, and as I've pursued further development,
  beyond my bachelor's degree in english- I've gained the skills needed to make a positive impact
  with greater efficiency. Carnegie Mellon has given me an understanding of Javascript and Python,
  and I'm excited to use my communication skills and experience from my past career to make a
  difference by creating valuable digital experiences and tools.
</p>
<p>
  On this site, I've catalogued a broad range of my projects, both creative and technical.
  Feel free to explore my projects by following the links on the navagation panel above!
